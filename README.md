## Proposal
**App Name:** 	Recipe App
**Purpose:** 	Allows a user to browse an open source API for recipes. If a user creates an 
account, they will be able to save favorite recipes obtained from the API or add their own. The app will allow users to create “folders” to better organize their recipe(s).
